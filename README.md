Two of which are feature base methods (Bag-of-words model, feature model).BoW and syntactic features are extracted and logistic regression is applied. Other three are neural networks (BERT model, attention model, Character CNN). Each module contains of configuration file (`config.jsn`), model implementation and run script for training/testing (`main_{model}.py`).

### Requirements
